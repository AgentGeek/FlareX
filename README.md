This app is a modified work of original ColdCloud by [Stevy](https://gitlab.com/stevyneutron/coldcloud-android) i have removed several parts from this app and makde some changes here and there to make it work with latest android SDK as a fan myself i just couldn't see this awesome app being in forgotten sack. There might be some more changes but overall i won't be focusing on this one bad boy at all.



![Get it on Google Play](https://pcdn.ximg.us/images/public/GetItOnGooglePlay.png)



Note: I have changed the package name and app name as there are some changes without them it won't be the fan favorite ColdCloud especially the Google Maps integration.

I had to remove it completely as i want to publish the app to appstore and i don't want to meddle with new privacy declarations.

There might be some more breaking changes in upcoming future but i can't gurantee anything apart from making the app compatible with latest SDK.

Data collection through Sentry DSN is also removed(blame me, i just don't like sentry)

There might be some old non functioning things in the app which might or might not crash the app for you.



The code is opensourced as per original author and i won't be doing anything of the sorts to include tracking or ads on this app.



You are more than welcome to push changes and i will make sure to test them out and publish an update on google play store as soon as i can.
